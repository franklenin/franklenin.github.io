Hi, my name is Frank Sierra. I'm a Mexican AI Engineer and experimental scientist with a passion for cutting-edge technologies in AI and Neuroscience. I'm currently based in Dublin, Ireland, working as an ML Engineer. Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at the prestigious Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, Germany.

#### I offer two types of services:

1. Training to land your first job, if you are moving from academia to industry. 
2. Consultancy on AI technologies, in case you want to star your own company (or want to automate some of your processes).

In either case, just send me an email and we can talk about it. 

I have spent my time in many research centers and different laboratories including Mexico City, Trento, Trieste, Berlin, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Dublin. I have presented my research work at different international conferences in differents countryes such as Brazil, USA, Mexico, Germany, Italy, and Finland.
