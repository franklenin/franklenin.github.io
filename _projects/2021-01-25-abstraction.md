In this project I created an automatic system for detect parasites in videos. At the core of this system, there is a Transformer (Detection Transforer: DeTr) that analizes the videos.

The idea is quite simple: 

i) Our users make a fecal sample of the animal they want to test. 
i) They send a video of that sample to our servers.
ii) In our servers we deploy DeTr to analyze these videos.
iv) After this, our users receive a summary of the analyses.

The summary tells our users whether theirs animals areinfected,and if so, which parasites were detected.
